### Other Changes

* test against stable Go 1.27 instead of the release candidate\n\nGo 1.27.0 has been generally available since August 2026 (now at\n1.27.1). Replace the temporary 1.27rc1 matrix entry with the stable\n1.27 line so CI resolves and tests against the latest 1.27.x patch\nrelease, matching the same treatment already applied in the main\nsemrel repository CI matrix.\n\nNo Go 1.28 pre-release exists yet to add (dev cycle started July\n2026, RC1 not expected before around January 2027).\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com> (#25)
